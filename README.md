# Homero's Simple Clock Application

<br>

My first clock application.


## Summary

This was my first experience applying my knowledge on JavaScript to a project. I was surprised to see that variables could be applied to more than one method().

All in all it was a great step first step for me to start my journey as Software-Developer.
